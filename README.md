# Word-Guesser
This is a word guessing game which uses a dictionary file stored in binary trees to ask questions and try to guess the word that the user is thinking of.The program interacts with the user through a JApplet and uses GUI components to allow users to choose between options within the game. If the program cannot guess the word, the user can teach the word to the program and add it onto the binary tree, allowing the program to learn by means of basic artificial intelligence.
